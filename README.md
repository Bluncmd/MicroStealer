# MicroStealer
*A compact Discord Token Logger/Discord Token Grabber made in only 15 lines of code! Injects into discord for long-term use. <br />*

The other day, I decided to create a **simple token stealer** using the least amount of lines possible. This is how it came out!<br />
**Please note**, this is more of a <ins>PoC</ins> than a real grabber. You most likely wont be using this. However, when compiled with PyInstaller, it is quite small!

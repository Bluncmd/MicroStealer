# ðŸ’¾ MicroStealer
<h3 align="center">âš¡ A compact Discord Token Logger/Discord Token Grabber made in only 15 lines of code! Injects into discord for long-term use.</h3>

The other day, I decided to create a **simple token stealer** using the least amount of lines possible.<br />This is how it came out!<br />

**Please note**, this is more of a <ins>PoC</ins> than a real grabber.<br />You most likely wont be using this.<br />**However**, when compiled with **PyInstaller**, it is quite small!<br />
<h2 align="left">- Features -</h3>

* `Injects, so even if the user changes their token you have it! `
* `Works with any webhook, even if it's not discord! `
* `Only 15 lines of code! `

# Usage (If for some reason you want to use it)
**Simple!** Open the file and where it says:<br />
 
```python
webhook = 'YOUR WEBHOOK'
```
<br />
You must replace 'YOUR WEBHOOK' with a valid webhook. Because of the nature of this grabber, you can use any webhook.<br />
(Guilded, Discord, Telegram, even your own server! ðŸ‘€)

**Enjoy!** ðŸ˜Š
